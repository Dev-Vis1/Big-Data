## About
Big Data refers to large, complex datasets that require advanced tools and techniques to process, store, and analyze. In this course, Iâ€™m learning how to work with massive datasets, leveraging tools and technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases. This repository serves as a space where I document my learning process, share insights, and contribute to projects related to Big Data.

## Course Topics
Here are some of the key topics covered in the course:
1. **Introduction to Big Data**
2. **Hadoop and MapReduce**
3. **Spark and Distributed Computing**
4. **NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)**
5. **Data Warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
6. **Stream Processing with Apache Kafka**
7. **Big Data Analytics**
8. **Data Visualization in Big Data**


## Exercises
The repository contains individual exercises designed to reinforce each topic covered in the course. Each exercise includes:
- A **problem statement** with objectives
- A **solution** with code and explanations
- **Step-by-step guides** to help you understand the concepts behind the exercises

These exercises are intended to deepen your understanding of Big Data tools and their applications.

## Projects
In addition to the exercises, I will be working on several projects that apply Big Data techniques to solve real-world challenges. Some of the projects may include:
- **Data processing and analysis with Hadoop and Spark**
- **Building distributed applications with Spark**
- **Implementing NoSQL databases for large-scale data storage**
- **Real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka**
- **Data warehousing and business intelligence**

Projects will be added as I progress through the course, showcasing the practical application of Big Data technologies.

## Resources
This repository also includes valuable resources for learning Big Data:
- **Books:** Textbooks and online readings
- **Courses:** Additional courses, tutorials, and videos
- **Tools & Libraries:** Information on Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL databases, and other Big Data tools
